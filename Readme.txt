%%%%%%%%    Introduction    %%%%%%%%
%   This program gives the ideal CD nozzle geometry using the method of
%   characteristics for a complete steady, supersonic and isentropic flow. 

%%%%%%%%    Directions for running the program      %%%%%%%%
%   Run default or modify the problem parameters in nozzle.m and noz_cfd.m
%   1)  Run the TDnozzle.m program-  The rest of programs are necessary functions to run the principal.
%   
%%%%%%%%    Results      %%%%%%%%
